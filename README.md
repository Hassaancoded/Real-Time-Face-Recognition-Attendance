A real-time face recognition system using OpenCV and face_recognition. It detects faces via webcam, matches them with stored images, and displays the recognized name, roll number, and status. Ideal for attendance tracking and security applications. ðŸš€

Features
âœ… Real-time face detection and recognition
âœ… Automatic attendance marking
âœ… Uses pre-stored images for identification
âœ… Displays name, roll number, and status
âœ… Simple UI with OpenCV

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Real-Time-Face-Recognition.git
cd Real-Time-Face-Recognition

Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy face-recognition

Ensure you have a folder named Images/Images inside the project directory, where each image filename corresponds to the person's name.

Usage
Run the script:

python face_recognition.py
The webcam will open and recognize faces from the stored dataset.

Press 'q' to exit.
